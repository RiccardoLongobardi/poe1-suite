# CLAUDE.md — poe1-suite

Instructions for any Claude Code session working in this repo.
Read this file top-to-bottom before doing any work.

## Who the user is

- **Riccardo** — Italian PoE 1 player, builds tools for himself (ric.longobardi@outlook.it).
- Prefers conversation in **Italian**, technical identifiers/commands in **English**.
- Values: "niente fittizio" — no fake/mocked data. Every module ships with real fixtures and is end-to-end playable before the next one starts.

## What this repo is

`poe1-suite` is a uv workspace monorepo of Path of Exile 1 tools. FastAPI backend on port 8765, React/Mantine shell planned. Membership rules:

- `packages/*` → library packages (`poe1-core`, `poe1-shared`, `poe1-pricing`, `poe1-builds`, `poe1-fob`). Each exposes a FastAPI `make_router(settings)` when it has HTTP endpoints.
- `apps/*` → runnable apps. `apps/server/` mounts all routers. `apps/shell/` is the React frontend and is **excluded** from the uv workspace.

## Non-negotiable conventions

1. **Python 3.12**, Pydantic v2, FastAPI, httpx async. All Pydantic models are `frozen=True`. Use `populate_by_name=True` with `camelCase` aliases when serializing to JSON that matches external APIs.
2. **`uv` is the tool** — never `pip`, never `python -m venv`. Commands below.
3. **Test import mode is `importlib`** (configured in `pyproject.toml`). To avoid conftest namespace collisions between packages, each `packages/*/` dir has an empty `__init__.py` extending the dotted module path. Don't remove those.
4. **Ruff is strict** — `E W F I B SIM C4 UP ANN Q RUF` are enabled. Tests are exempt from `ANN`. `**/generated/**` is excluded entirely. Do **NOT** enable the `TCH` rules — they break Pydantic v2 (field annotations need to be importable at runtime).
5. **Mypy is `strict = true`** across 60+ source files. Every public function must be fully typed. `tests/*` has `disallow_untyped_defs = false` override.
6. **No fake data ever.** Tests use real fixtures captured from live poe.ninja / pobb.in. If you need new fixtures, capture them live and commit them under `packages/<pkg>/tests/fixtures/`.

## The gate (run before declaring anything done)

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy .
uv run pytest
```

All four must pass with zero errors. Current baseline: **324 tests green (2 skipped — integration/LLM), 74 files type-checked clean, 72 files formatted clean**.

## What's built (state as of 2026-04-25, end of Step 6)

| Module | Package | Routes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domain models | `poe1-core` | — | done (Build, Intent, Plan, Item, League, enums) |
| HTTP/config/logging | `poe1-shared` | — | done (httpx + tenacity + diskcache, pydantic-settings, structlog) |
| PoB ingest + parser + mapper | `poe1-fob` | `POST /fob/analyze-pob` | done (raw / pobb.in / pastebin; full XML parse; Build mapping) |
| poe.ninja economy (currency, uniques, cluster, jewels, …) | `poe1-pricing` | `GET /pricing/quote`, `GET /pricing/snapshot` | done |
| poe.ninja ladder builds | `poe1-builds` | `GET /builds/list`, `GET /builds/detail` | done (protobuf columnar search + JSON hydration, 19 ascendancy fan-out, `main_skill` / `defense_type` filters) |
| IntentExtractor | `poe1-fob` | `POST /fob/extract-intent` | done (hybrid rule-based IT+EN + Anthropic Haiku tool-use fallback; 15 fixture cases; confidence threshold 0.70) |
| Ranking Engine | `poe1-fob` | `POST /fob/recommend` | done (SourceAggregator fan-out → hard-constraint filter → 6-dim weighted scorer → top-N; 49 unit tests) |
| UI shell | `apps/shell` | — | done (React 18 + Vite 5 + Mantine v7 + TanStack Query; Build Finder + PoB Analyzer; `npm run dev` on :5173) |

Server: `uv run poe1-server` → <http://127.0.0.1:8765>. `/health`, `/version`, plus all the routes above.
Shell dev: `cd apps/shell && npm run dev` → <http://127.0.0.1:5173> (proxies API to :8765).

## What's next (Step 8)

- **Planner** — `POST /fob/plan`. Dato un `RankedBuild` (o un PoB), genera un piano di upgrade a step con costi da poe.ninja pricing.
- **Faustus flipper** — nuovo package `poe1-faustus` per flip di valuta basato su poe.ninja bulk trades.

## Project-specific gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **poe.ninja post-PoE2 endpoints:** `/poe1/api/economy/stash/{version}/...` for prices, `/poe1/api/builds/{version}/search` (protobuf) for ladder. `league=` param wants the **display name** ("Mirage"), not the URL slug. The old `/api/data/currencyoverview` scheme is dead.
- **pytest conftest collision:** Always `--import-mode=importlib`. The `packages/__init__.py` + `packages/<pkg>/__init__.py` empty files exist specifically to make conftests resolve as `packages.builds.tests.conftest` etc.
- **uv workspace `packages/*` glob** will pick up `packages/__pycache__` once Python compiles the namespace package. `pyproject.toml` excludes it explicitly — don't remove that exclude.
- **Aliased Pydantic fields in JSON responses**: FastAPI serializes by alias by default (`response_model_by_alias=True`). So `path_of_building_export` surfaces as `pathOfBuildingExport` in JSON; `class_name` surfaces as `class`; `defensive_stats` as `defensiveStats`. Tests that assert on the response dict must use the aliased keys.
- **diskcache has no `py.typed`** → mypy override `ignore_missing_imports = true`.
- **Protobuf generated file** at `packages/builds/src/poe1_builds/generated/ninja_builds_pb2.py` is ignored by ruff and mypy. Regenerate with `grpcio-tools` if the upstream schema changes; keep the raw `.proto` source under that dir too.

## How to pick up a new Step

1. Read the latest `docs/architecture.md` if it exists.
2. Run `uv run pytest -q` — if anything's red, fix that first.
3. Create a new `packages/<name>/` following the pricing/builds template: `src/poe1_<name>/{__init__.py, models.py, service.py, sources/*.py, router.py}`, `tests/{conftest.py, fixtures/, test_*.py}`, `pyproject.toml` declaring the package and its deps.
4. Capture real fixtures first, then write models to match them, then write the source adapter, then the service facade, then the router.
5. Close the step by running the full gate and updating this file's "What's built" table.
6. Commit and **push** the worktree branch: `git push origin claude/friendly-kowalevski-9d17f8`. This is mandatory after every step — don't ask, just do it.

## Environment

- `POE_LEAGUE=Mirage` (current league as of 2026-04-24).
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — only needed when Step 5A (IntentExtractor) lands.
- `POESESSID` — optional, only for authenticated GGG Trade calls.
- `.env.example` at the repo root shows the full list. Never commit `.env`.
